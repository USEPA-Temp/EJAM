NOTE:   A VERSION OF THIS IS WITHIN server.R 
 and this was work in progress to possibly move it to a separate function
 but that would require passing all these tables as parameters 
 or assuming they are in memory. 
\preformatted{
    To pass all the reactives as parameters, you would do this: 
    
 selectIndustry1=input$selectIndustry1, 
 selectIndustry2=input$selectIndustry2,
 cutoff=getCutoff(), 
 maxcutoff=getMaxcutoff(), 
 get_unique=TRUE, 
 avoidorphans=TRUE,
 doExpandradius=doExpandradius(), 
 selectNaicsDS1= input$selectNaicsDS1, 
 selectNaicsDS2 =input$selectNaicsDS2)
 }
}
