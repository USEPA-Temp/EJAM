\usage{
sum_pctlowinc(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.table with pctlowinc, povknownratio, Census2010Totalpop, POP100
where povknownratio is count of those for whom the poverty ratio was known, which is
the more correct denominator when calcuating percent poor or percent low income,
although EJSCREEN does that but subsequently treats pctlowinc as essentially a
percentage of all population in the block group, which is generally not very different
than using the other denominator.}
