lookup.pctile.US(
  data,
  thisregion = "USA",
  geolevel = "usa",

\arguments{
\item{data}{indicators data.table?}

\item{thisregion}{default is USA}

\item{geolevel}{default is usa, can be used to get state or region percentiles}

\item{fields2process}{names of columns to use in data}

\item{lookupfields}{corresponding version of those colnames as used in the lookup table}

\item{fields_outputnames}{colnames for percentiles in outputs}

\item{fields_outputnames_means}{colnames for means in outputs}

\item{factors}{vector of scaling values to convert to correct units like 1, 0.01, etc. (see source code)}
}
\value{
data.table of 100 percentiles and mean (in rows) for each indicator (in columns)
inedx_EJ_Neuro',
}
\description{
Still needs to have in global envt statestats, regionstats, or usastats depending on geolevel -
  Can recode to make those data() in this package.
}
\details{
CURRENTLY HARD CODED TO USE THESE SPECIFIC FIELDS - NEEDS TO BE MADE GENERIC.
  This should be about the same as ejanalysis::lookup.pctile()
  using lookup tables from something like ejscreen::ejscreen.lookuptables()
  See user ejanalysis, ejscreen and ejanalysis packages on GitHub
