\title{EJSCREEN demographic and enviromental indicators for Census block groups

This is essentially the EJSCREEN dataset, but could be replaced with something using different indicators.
  It has demographic and environmental data from EJSCREEN.
  NOTE: It also has the race/ethnic subgroups that add up to minority or people of color, 
  while EJSCREEN as of Jan 2022 did not have those variables.
  However those variables are not filled in for Puerto Rico, so 
  US totals will include PR for pop but not for hisp, for example.
  
  The 2020 version of EJSCREEN was released in 2020/2021 and used through Jan 2022. 
  It is based on American Community Survey (ACS) data for 2014-2018.
  Each year this could be created as for the latest version.
  It is also available in a similar form via the ejscreen package on github, ejscreen::bg20 for the 2020 version, 
  but there are differences in which columns are kept.
  
  It is a data.table of US Census blockgroups (not blocks). Approx 220,333 rows, approx 100 columns.
  See \url{https:\\www.epa.gov\ejscreen}
  names(bgstats2020) include bgfips, pop, pctlowinc, pcthisp, etc.
  or bgstats2020 as renamed

  # notes on cleaning up and changing the dataset starting from ejscreen::bg20 etc
