Description: Basic user interface for obtaining EJScreen batch results 
  (environmental and demographic conditions near multiple sites). 
  This R Shiny app provides a very basic user interface that lets a user 
  specify a radius in miles for circular buffering, and then 
  upload a csv file of point locations, with a column each for lat/lon, 
  and it draws a very simple map of circular buffers at those points. 
  It then can request from EPA servers an EJScreen standard report on each buffer.
  The site-specific results, obtained one at a time (slowly) via an EJScreen API,
  are compiled into a single table, one row per buffered point, with all the 
  indicator values as columns. Any extra columns uploaded along with lat/lon are 
  included as the first set of columns in the results table. The results table 
  can be sorted by a column, or searched (e.g., by state or facility name). 
  The full table can be downloaded as a csv file that can be opened as a spreadsheet. 
  This is intended as a very basic, slow interim tool for batches of EJScreen reports,
  while the new Environmental Justice Analysis Multisite (EJAM) tool is developed.
  Important caveat: These site-by-site results in many cases cannot be summarized
  accurately as overall statistics on the population overall or average person.
